## Overview
"Fate/Zero" is a Japanese light novel written by Gen Urobuchi, illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi, and is a prequel to all routes in Type-Moon's visual novel, Fate/stay night.

## Key Characters

- **Artoria Pendragon** A strong saber class servant. She is also the servant of Emiya Kiritsugu  
- **Gilgamesh**: An archer class servant. He is an arrogant but powerful servant. 
- **Waver Velvet**: Master of rider.  Waver steals his teacher's artifact early on and uses it to summon Iskandar during the Fourth Holy Grail War to force the Magus Association to recognize his genius.

## Plot Summary
The story of Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to the events of Fate/Stay Night, detailing the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The Einzbern family is determined to achieve victory in the Fourth War after three consecutive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the notorious "mage killer," Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs all means necessary to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person often comes at the cost of another's life. Thus, this is the source of conflict he once sought to eliminate due to finite resources/abilities. For the sake of humanity, he resolves to ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others.

## Why I love this series
Because of how Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. And making him lose his sanity because of his ideals are not good enough.
